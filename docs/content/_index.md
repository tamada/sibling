## :speaking_head: Description

When the directory has too may sub directories, we are tiresome to traverse whole of them.
Because, we lose where we are.
Ideally, we move directory by specifying the next, not directory name.

The command like following makes us tired :-1:.

    cd ../next_directory_name

We should type command like below :+1:.

    cdnext

For this, I implemented `sibling`.
